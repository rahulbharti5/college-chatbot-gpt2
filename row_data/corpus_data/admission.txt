As I told you before I want a government engineering college in my home state. This college was good option for me The admission process is very simple you just have to apply on online councelling website UPTAC they give a seat in college and you have to report physically at college for your further admission process.
I got admission in this college via UPSEE (Uttar Pradesh Entrance Examination). I choose this college because of Good transport. Fewer fees and it has Good infrastructure. I got qualified for UPSEE then gone to counselling selected fee waiver seat and locked my choice with 20000 rupees. Then gone to college to confirm it during may-June.
